# NotDarkPaper

Hi, thank you to Readme !

Walletaya is yet another portfolio app, and yes, I created this project because other portfolio applications doesn't fit my needs, and YES I have the pretention to say : "My app is better" ðŸ˜œ

What is important to understand is that my goal with this app is not to compete with existing apps (if it does, so much better !) but it is to federate around a little and strong community ! I want to be aware of my user needs and that is why my project is open-source.

My name is Esteban, I am a French Front-end engineer and I am 27 (in 2024).

I learned development at 16 on summer vacations when I was at school. When I was at school I learned a terrible new, my level was unsatisfying and I had to renew my year ... A big mind defeat for me because I was not so bad but I moved to another place and this year was difficult for me.

I started to learn PHP/HTML/CSS with "le-site-du-zÃ©ro" which becames OpenClassroom, and it was a revelation. Some weeks before was playing Minecraft and Legos, and here I am learning code. After some weeks, my first project was to create an Web Interface for my brother who had start a domotic project with a Raspberry PI. At this period we were distanced by hundreds kilometers and we had to work remotely, it was fun ! The satisfying moment was when I delivred him my one-week-work for the first time, then he installed it, gived me the link to access his local network on internet and by clicking a button, I turned on/off the light of his living room !

After some years, for High School I choosed Epitech, but after one year I was forced to stop due to the high cost of this school. So I started to search for work. It started my career in a tiny campaign company, I learned a lot of things, I reworked their logo.

After some years, I felt the need to evolve and I changed of company, a bigger one where I learned a lot more. In this company I specialised myself around front development and UI/UX design, It was really funny.

After some years, I switched of company again for a bigger one in Paris ecosystem. On this one I really technically stepped up as I am in a small team responsible for evolve technical stack of each teams, my perimeter was oriented on front-end and UI/UX design.

Now, I wan't to go a step further by creating an application from scratch and deploy to smartphone application stores. I want to develop the most UX friendly application possible.
