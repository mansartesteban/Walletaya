# NotDarkPaper

Hi, thank you to Readme !

Walletaya is yet another portfolio app, and yes, I created this project because other portfolio applications doesn't fit my needs, and YES I have the pretention to say : "My app is better" ðŸ˜œ

What is important to understand is that my goal with this app is not to compete with existing apps (but if it does, so much better !)
